# task-2
This project builds a pipeline for web scraping, embedding, and retrieval. It uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for extracting website text, splits it into chunks, encodes chunks with `SentenceTransformer`, and creates a FAISS index for semantic search. Queries retrieve relevant text chunks to generate responses.
